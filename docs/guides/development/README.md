**When to use:** Every new feature development

### [Universal Full-Stack Standard](./universal-fullstack-standard.md)

Database-first workflow ensuring clean architecture from database to frontend.

**When to use:** All full-stack features

### [QA Checklist](./qa-checklist.md)

Mandatory 6-phase QA process before every commit (Build → Lint → Test → Manual → E2E → Git).

**When to use:** Before every commit

### [API-First Workflow](./api-first-workflow.md)

Design OpenAPI spec before implementation to ensure frontend-backend alignment.

**When to use:** Features with API endpoints

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which standards are mandatory?**
A: Feature Development, Universal Full-Stack, QA Checklist, Security Practices (for sensitive data), Audit Framework (for compliance).

**Q: Can I skip a standard if I'm prototyping?**
A: Security and QA standards should never be skipped. Others can be simplified for prototypes but must be completed before production.
