- **Current Pace**: On track (day 1 of 7)
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Complex permission checking algorithms may require additional optimization
  - Integration with existing auth system may reveal additional requirements
  - Performance testing may require additional optimization work

### Daily Progress Target

- **Target**: ~14% progress per day
- **Day 1 (2025-09-13)**: 5% achieved (planning phase)
- **Day 2 Target**: 19% (complete API contracts and DB schema)
- **Day 3 Target**: 33% (backend repository layer)
- **Day 4 Target**: 52% (backend service layer)
- **Day 5 Target**: 71% (frontend core services)
- **Day 6 Target**: 90% (integration and testing)

## 🔍 Quality Metrics

### Security Metrics (Target)

- [ ] 0 security vulnerabilities (critical/high)
- [ ] 100% permission checks audited
- [ ] 0 privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- [ ] All admin actions logged

### Performance Metrics (Target)

- [ ] <50ms average permission check response time
- [ ] > 95% cache hit rate for frequent permission checks
- [ ] <100ms worst-case permission hierarchy traversal
- [ ] Zero performance regression in existing features

### Code Quality Metrics (Target)

- [ ] > 95% test coverage for security-critical code
- [ ] > 90% test coverage overall
- [ ] 0 linting errors
- [ ] 0 type checking errors
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity <10 for all methods

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

- **Permission checking performance**: May require significant optimization effort
- **Role hierarchy complexity**: Circular dependency detection algorithms
- **Cache invalidation**: Complex scenarios with multiple role changes

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Performance**: Early prototyping and benchmarking
- **Hierarchy**: Implement depth limits and validation upfront
- **Caching**: Start with simple TTL-based strategy, enhance iteratively

### Contingency Plans

- **Scope Reduction**: Remove advanced hierarchy features if timeline at risk
- **Performance Fallback**: Implement simpler caching if Redis integration complex
- **Testing Reduction**: Focus on critical path testing if time constraints

This progress tracking ensures we maintain high quality while meeting the aggressive timeline for this security-critical feature.
