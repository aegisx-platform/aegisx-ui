- Performance testing from Week 3
- Database query optimization
- Implement caching (Redis)
- Use database indexes effectively

**Contingency**:

- Dedicated optimization sprint
- Database scaling (read replicas)

#### R4: Ministry Requirements Change

**Mitigation**:

- Monitor DMSIC announcements weekly
- Modular design for export views
- Version control for export schemas
- Regular compliance audits

**Contingency**:

- Emergency update sprint
- Parallel support for old and new formats

#### R12: Timeline Delays

**Mitigation**:

- Daily standup tracking
- Weekly progress reports
- Early identification of blockers
- 10% buffer time built into schedule
