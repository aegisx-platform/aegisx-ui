## 4. Budget Reservation Lifecycle

**Entity:** `budget_reservations`

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ACTIVE: PR submitted & budget reserved

    ACTIVE --> COMMITTED: PR approved → PO created
    ACTIVE --> RELEASED: PR rejected/cancelled
    ACTIVE --> EXPIRED: 30 days passed

        reserved → spent
    end note

    note right of EXPIRED
        Auto-expire after 30 days
        if PR not approved

```

### Budget Reservation States

## 🔄 Cross-Workflow State Dependencies

### PR → PO → Receipt Flow

```
PR: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → PO_CREATED
                 ↓
PO: DRAFT → APPROVED → SENT → PARTIAL_RECEIVED → FULLY_RECEIVED → COMPLETED
                                        ↓
Receipt: DRAFT → INSPECTING → APPROVED → POSTED
                                           ↓
Inventory: quantity_on_hand updated
          drug_lots created
          inventory_transactions logged
```

### Budget Lifecycle Through Procurement

```
Budget: allocated_amount (Beginning of year)
            ↓
PR submitted → reserve_budget()
            ↓
Budget: reserved_amount += PR.total
            ↓
PR approved → commit_budget()
            ↓
Budget: reserved_amount -= PR.total
        spent_amount += PO.total
            ↓
Budget: available = allocated - reserved - spent
```

## 📝 Notes

### State Transition Rules

1. **No Backward Transitions**
   - States only move forward (except cancellation)
   - Cannot revert APPROVED → DRAFT

2. **Atomic State Changes**
   - State changes happen in transactions
   - Includes all related updates (budget, inventory, etc.)

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All state changes logged with:
     - User ID
     - Timestamp
     - Reason (for REJECTED/CANCELLED)

4. **Side Effects**
   - State changes trigger database functions:
     - `reserve_budget()` on PR SUBMITTED
     - `commit_budget()` on PR APPROVED
     - `release_budget()` on PR CANCELLED/REJECTED
     - `update_inventory_from_receipt()` on Receipt POSTED

### Common Patterns

**Happy Path (PR → PO → Receipt):**

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → APPROVED → PO_CREATED →
PO:SENT → FULLY_RECEIVED → COMPLETED →
Receipt:POSTED
```

**Cancellation Path:**

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → CANCELLED → BUDGET_RELEASED
```

**Rejection Path:**

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → REJECTED → Archive
```
