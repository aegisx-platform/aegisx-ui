# Knex to Drizzle ORM Migration - Executive Summary

## Quick Facts

| Metric                   | Value                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Migration Difficulty** | MEDIUM                                           |
| **Total Effort**         | 210-300 developer hours                          |
| **Timeline**             | 3-5 weeks (with 2-3 developers)                  |
| **Scope**                | ~15,000 lines of Knex code                       |
| **Risk Level**           | MEDIUM (manageable with proper planning)         |
| **ROI**                  | HIGH (type safety, performance, maintainability) |

## What Needs to Change

### Code Affected (65+ files total)

**High Impact (45-50% effort):**

- 2 Base repositories (BaseRepository, BaseAuditRepository)
- 15 Domain repositories (RBAC, Users, Auth, File operations, etc.)

**Medium Impact (40-50% effort):**

- 19 Database migrations
- 9 Seed files
- 20+ Service layer files (update queries)
- Test files (update repository instantiation)

**Low Impact (10-20% effort):**

- Configuration files (knexfile.ts removal)
- Documentation updates
- Setup scripts

---

## Key Challenges

1. **RBAC Repository** - Most complex with subquery joins (852 lines)
2. **Transaction Handling** - 36 uses throughout codebase
3. **Raw SQL Usage** - 26+ raw SQL calls in migrations
4. **Multiple Interdependencies** - Repositories depend on each other
5. **Active Database** - Need careful deployment strategy

---

## Why Switch?

### Benefits (Significant)

- **Type Safety**: Single source of truth for schema and types
- **Performance**: Smaller bundle (~50KB vs 200KB), faster compilation
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support, clearer API
- **Maintenance**: Schema changes in one place, easier onboarding
- **Security**: Native parameterization prevents SQL injection

### Drawbacks (Minimal)

- **Effort**: 3-5 week migration sprint required
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation needed
- **Team Knowledge**: Learning curve (but lower than Knex)

---

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (5-7 days)

1. Set up Drizzle schema from current migrations
2. Create Drizzle BaseRepository
3. Write validation tests

### Phase 2: Complex Queries (7-10 days)

1. Migrate RBAC repository (validates approach)
2. Migrate user/auth repositories
3. Handle transactions and edge cases

### Phase 3: Remaining Repositories (5-7 days)

1. Migrate remaining domain repositories
2. Update seed/migration files
3. Integration testing

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (5-7 days)

1. Update all services
2. E2E testing
3. Performance validation
4. Cleanup and documentation

---

## Critical Success Factors

**Must Have:**

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Transaction rollback works
- [ ] Migration/seed flow works

**Nice to Have:**

- [ ] Performance improvement (10-20%)
- [ ] Code reduction (20-30%)
- [ ] Type safety improvements

---

## Resource Needs

**Team:**

- 2-3 backend developers (80-100h each)
- 1 QA engineer (30-40h)
- 1 tech lead oversight (10-20h)

**Time:**

- 3-5 weeks calendar time
- Can be done in parallel with other work

**Infrastructure:**

- Test database for validation
- Feature branch for development
- Blue-green deployment capability

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** with team
2. **Allocate resources** - Confirm availability
3. **Create detailed sprint plan** - Week-by-week breakdown
4. **Prepare environment** - Install Drizzle, set up test DB
5. **Start with BaseRepository** - Establishes patterns
6. **Validate with RBAC** - Tests most complex patterns
7. **Roll out systematically** - Domain by domain

## Questions to Discuss

1. **Timing**: Can we allocate team in next 1-2 weeks?
2. **Resources**: Do we have 2-3 backend developers available?
3. **Scope**: Should we do this before or after feature X?
4. **Testing**: Do we have capacity for comprehensive QA?
5. **Rollout**: Should we do feature branch or gradual migration?

---

## Conclusion

**This migration is recommended and feasible.** The effort is significant but well-defined, with clear phases and checkpoints. The benefits (type safety, maintainability, developer experience) provide strong ROI.

With proper planning and a focused team, this can be completed in 3-5 weeks without disrupting other development.
