/**
 * Theme Module (Legacy - Deprecated)
 *
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Theme management has been migrated to @aegisx/ui library.
 *
 * All theme-related components and services have been moved to:
 * @aegisx/ui library
 *
 * Use these imports instead:
 * - AxThemeService: Simple file-based theme management
 * - AxThemeSwitcherComponent: Theme switcher UI component
 *
 * import { AxThemeService, AxThemeSwitcherComponent } from '@aegisx/ui';
 *
 * This directory is kept for reference only and should not be used.
 * All old theme files have been removed.
 *
 * Note: M3ThemeService and StylePresetService have been backed up (.backup.ts)
 * for future feature additions. Current implementation uses simpler file-based
 * theme switching via AxThemeService.
