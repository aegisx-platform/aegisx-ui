/**
 * Platform Departments Plugin
 *
 * Central plugin for managing the organization structure and hierarchy.
 * Provides CRUD operations for departments with real-time WebSocket events.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
 * - Department hierarchy management
 * - Real-time WebSocket events for all operations
 * - Dropdown and hierarchical tree endpoints
 *
 * Following Fastify best practices:
 * - Service instantiation with proper dependency injection
 * - Encapsulation through plugin scoping (plain async function, no fp wrapper)
 * - Lifecycle management with hooks
 *
 * Note: This is a leaf module plugin (routes + controllers only), so it uses
 * a plain async function without fp() wrapper, following the plugin pattern specification.
