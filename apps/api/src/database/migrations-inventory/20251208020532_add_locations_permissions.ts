/**
 * Migration: Add Locations Permissions
 *
 * Creates locations role and permissions with role hierarchy support.
 * The locations role inherits from admin role automatically.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Idempotent: Safe to run multiple times
 * - Atomic: All operations in transaction
 * - Hierarchical: Supports role inheritance via parent_id
 * - Module role: Creates locations role and links all permissions to it
 * - Admin access: Admin role has wildcard permission (*:*) for automatic full access
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Level 1: admin (parent_id: NULL) → Has *:* wildcard permission
 * - Level 2: locations (parent_id: admin.id) ← Creates this
 * - Level 3: Custom roles can be created under locations later
 *
 * Generated by: CRUD Generator v2.1.0
 * Resource: inventory:locations
 * Domain: inventory/master-data
 * Generated: 2025-12-08T02:05:32.405Z
