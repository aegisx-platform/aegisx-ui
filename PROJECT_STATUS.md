1. **✅ COMPLETED: CRUD Generator Templates Enhancement & Production-Ready Code Generation**
   - **Problem**: CRUD generator templates had multiple issues preventing production-ready code generation
   - **Solution**: Complete overhaul of CRUD generator templates for both domain and flat structures
   - **Key Fixes**:
     - **hasEvents Logic**: Fixed `hasEvents: false` appearing when `--with-events` flag not used - now only shows when events enabled
     - **Module Metadata**: Simplified from complex objects to simple `MODULE_NAME` constants for cleaner code
     - **Dynamic Import Paths**: Made all domain template imports fully dynamic - no manual fixes needed after generation
     - **Query Parameters**: Fixed sortBy/sortOrder parameter compatibility with BaseRepository expectations
     - **BaseRepository Enhancement**: Added missing `hasNext`/`hasPrev` pagination fields required by API schemas

     - `apps/api/src/shared/websocket/websocket.plugin.ts` - Fastify plugin with Socket.IO server setup
     - `apps/web/src/app/shared/services/websocket.service.ts` - Angular WebSocket service with Signals
     - `apps/web/src/app/shared/state/base-realtime-state.manager.ts` - Universal state management pattern
     - `apps/web/src/app/features/rbac/services/rbac-state.manager.ts` - RBAC-specific state managers
     - `apps/api/src/modules/default/test-websocket.routes.ts` - API test endpoints for WebSocket events
     - `test-websocket.html` - Comprehensive HTML test interface
     - `apps/web/src/app/test-rbac-websocket.component.ts` - Angular integration test component
   - **Architecture Patterns**:
     - **WebSocket Plugin**: Proper Fastify plugin with decorators and lifecycle management
     - **Event Service**: Centralized event emission with feature-specific methods
     - **State Synchronization**: Real-time frontend-backend state synchronization
     - **Conflict Detection**: Multi-user editing conflict detection and resolution
     - **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - **Testing Infrastructure**: HTML test page + Angular test component + API test endpoints
   - **Result**: Production-ready real-time communication system for RBAC and future features

2. **✅ COMPLETED: Multi-Instance Development System - Complete Instance Isolation**
   - **Problem**: Port conflicts and container name clashes when cloning repos for parallel feature development
   - **Solution**: Revolutionary approach using complete instance-specific Docker Compose files instead of override files
   - **Key Breakthrough**: Changed from `docker-compose.override.yml` to complete `docker-compose.instance.yml` files
   - **Core Architecture**:
     - **Complete Port Isolation**: Each instance uses entirely separate compose file with no dual port mappings
     - **Smart Package.json Scripts**: Automatically detect and use instance files with fallback to base files
     - **Folder-Based Hashing**: Consistent port assignment based on folder name suffix
     - **Zero-Conflict Design**: No more dual port configurations that caused conflicts
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Automatic Port Assignment**: Uses folder suffix hash for consistent port calculation
     - **Container Isolation**: Each instance gets unique container names (aegisx\_{suffix}\_postgres)
     - **Volume Isolation**: Separate database volumes per instance to prevent data mixing
     - **Environment Generation**: Auto-creates .env.local and docker-compose.instance.yml
     - **Port Registry**: Global tracking of port assignments across all instances
     - **Conflict Detection**: Automatic port conflict checking and old container cleanup warnings
   - **Files Enhanced**:
     - `scripts/setup-env.sh` - Now generates complete instance files, added conflict detection
     - `package.json` - Smart docker scripts that auto-detect instance files
     - `.gitignore` - Added `docker-compose.instance.yml` exclusion
     - `docs/development/multi-instance-setup.md` - Updated to reflect new architecture
     - `docs/references/multi-instance-commands.md` - Updated command examples
   - **Port Assignment Strategy**:
     - Main repo (`aegisx-starter`): Default ports (5432, 6379, 3333, 4200)
     - Feature repos (`aegisx-starter-{name}`): Hash-based unique ports
     - Example: `aegisx-starter-mpv` → PostgreSQL: 5433, Redis: 6381, API: 3334
   - **Management Features**: List instances, check conflicts, stop instances, cleanup unused resources
   - **Result**: True zero-conflict parallel development with complete instance isolation

### ✅ Completed Tasks (Session 7) - Previous Session

1. **✅ COMPLETED: Settings Feature Full Frontend-Backend Implementation**
   - **Problem**: User requested Settings feature with proper alignment between frontend and backend
   - **Solution**: Implemented complete Settings feature using agent-based development approach
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Agent-Based Development**: Used alignment-checker → fastify-backend-architect → angular-frontend-expert workflow
     - **Backend API**: Comprehensive Settings API already existed with 7 categories (api, email, features, general, security, storage, ui)
     - **Frontend Integration**: Created complete Settings UI with signal-based state management
     - **Dynamic Forms**: Implemented dynamic form generation based on backend setting metadata
     - **Optimistic Updates**: Real-time UI updates with rollback capability
     - **Bulk Operations**: Save multiple settings in single API call
   - **Files Created/Modified**:
     - `apps/web/src/app/features/settings/settings.service.ts` (comprehensive service with HTTP integration)
     - `apps/web/src/app/features/settings/settings.component.ts` (main component with tabs)
     - `apps/web/src/app/features/settings/components/dynamic-settings.component.ts` (dynamic form generator)
     - `apps/web/src/app/features/settings/settings.types.ts` (TypeScript types matching backend schemas)
     - `apps/api/src/database/seeds/002_enhanced_seed_data.ts` (updated Settings navigation link)
   - **Navigation Integration**: Updated Settings navigation from 'collapsible' to direct '/settings' link
   - **API Endpoint Fix**: Corrected bulk update endpoint from PUT /bulk to POST /bulk-update
   - **QA Standards Compliance**: Followed complete QA checklist (build ✅, lint ✅, test ✅)
   - **Result**: Fully functional Settings page with 7 categories, 25+ settings, real-time updates

### 📝 Important Notes

1. **Multi-Instance Development**: Use folder-based naming (aegisx-starter-{feature}) for automatic port assignment
2. **Angular Dynamic Ports**: All Angular apps now support dynamic ports via environment variables
3. **API Response Standard**: All new APIs must use `ApiSuccessResponseSchema` with optional pagination
4. **Database Columns**: Always use snake_case for database columns (e.g., `created_at`, not `createdAt`)
5. **Material Design Floating Labels**: Fixed via CSS-only solution in `/apps/web/src/styles/components/_form-utilities.scss`
6. **Form Utility Classes**: Use .form-xs, .form-compact, .form-standard, .form-lg for consistent form sizing
7. **TypeBox Schemas**: All API routes must use TypeBox schemas for validation
8. **CORS Configuration**: Explicit methods must be defined in CORS config (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
9. **Schema URI Validation**: Use `minLength: 1` for URLs that accept relative paths instead of `format: 'uri'`
10. **Frontend Proxy**: Development uses `/apps/web/proxy.conf.json` to forward API requests
11. **Role Management**: Always use `roleId` (UUID) in API requests, not `role` name
12. **BREAKING CHANGE Policy**: NEVER use "BREAKING CHANGE:", "BREAKING CHANGES:", or "BREAKING:" in commit messages
13. **Semantic Release**: Project maintains v1.x.x versioning only - v2.x.x releases are forbidden
14. **Migration Sequence**: Migration 014_add_user_roles_table.ts is critical for RBAC functionality

### 🐛 Known Issues

1. **WebSocket Reconnection**: Minor improvements needed for edge case handling
2. **Multi-Instance Cleanup**: Automated cleanup tools could be enhanced
3. **Port Conflicts**: Very rare edge cases with hash collisions
