# Security Best Practices Skill

## Quick Summary
Comprehensive security guide for implementing secure APIs in the AegisX platform.

## Use This Skill When:
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Adding protected routes
- Reviewing code for security vulnerabilities
- Validating user input
- Working with sensitive data
- Implementing JWT authentication
- Adding role-based or permission-based access control

## What It Covers:
- OWASP Top 10 Prevention (basics only)
- TypeBox Validation Patterns
- Fastify preValidation Hooks (CRITICAL: never throw errors)
