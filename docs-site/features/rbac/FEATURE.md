**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: feature/rbac-management  
**Started**: 2025-09-15  
**Target**: 2025-09-16

## 📋 Requirements

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want to manage roles and permissions through a comprehensive UI so that I can control access to system features and maintain security compliance.

### Functional Requirements

#### Role Management

- [ ] Create, view, edit, and delete roles
- [ ] Assign permissions to roles with granular control
- [ ] Manage role hierarchy and inheritance
- [ ] Bulk operations for role management
- [ ] Role template system for common role types

#### Permission Management

- [ ] View all available permissions by category
- [ ] Create custom permissions for business logic
- [ ] Edit permission descriptions and metadata
- [ ] Permission dependency management
- [ ] System vs custom permission distinction

#### User-Role Assignment

- [ ] Assign multiple roles to users
- [ ] Set role expiration dates
- [ ] Track role assignment history and audit trail
- [ ] Bulk role assignment operations
- [ ] Role conflict detection and resolution

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Performance: Page loads `<2s`, bulk operations handle 1000+ items
- [ ] Security: Audit trail for all RBAC changes, no privilege escalation
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Real-time: WebSocket integration for live role/permission updates
- [ ] Responsive: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Backend

- [ ] Role CRUD API endpoints: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/rbac/roles
- [ ] Permission CRUD API endpoints: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/rbac/permissions
- [ ] User-role assignment API: POST/DELETE /api/rbac/users/:id/roles
- [ ] Bulk operation APIs for efficient mass operations
- [ ] WebSocket events for real-time RBAC updates
- [ ] Unit tests passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Frontend

- [ ] Role management dashboard with hierarchy view
- [ ] Permission management with category filtering
- [ ] User-role assignment interface with search
- [ ] Bulk operation UI with progress indicators
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket integration
- [ ] Responsive Material Design components
- [ ] Component tests passing (>85% coverage)

### Integration

- [ ] Frontend-backend RBAC API integration working
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket updates functioning
- [ ] Error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading states and optimistic updates
- [ ] E2E tests covering all major workflows

## 🚨 Conflict Prevention

### Database Changes

- [ ] Tables/columns reserved: user*roles, roles.*, permissions.\_
- [ ] Migration 014 already applied (user_roles table exists)
- [ ] No new database changes needed - uses existing RBAC schema
- [ ] No conflicts with other features

### API Changes

- [ ] Endpoints reserved: /api/rbac/_, /api/roles/_, /api/permissions/\*
- [ ] Schemas documented in TypeBox format
- [ ] Extends existing Users module APIs
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with current /api/roles

### Frontend Changes

- [ ] Routes reserved: /rbac/_, /roles/_, /permissions/\*
- [ ] Components planned: RbacDashboard, RoleManager, PermissionManager
- [ ] Integrates with existing WebSocket RBAC state managers
- [ ] Uses shared Material Design components

## 📊 Dependencies

### Depends On

- [x] Feature: RBAC WebSocket Integration - Uses existing state managers
- [x] Database: Migration 014 - user_roles table and enhanced RBAC schema
- [x] Backend: Users module - Extends existing /api/roles endpoint
- [x] Frontend: WebSocket service and RBAC state managers

### Blocks

- [ ] Feature: Advanced User Analytics - Depends on RBAC audit trail

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Architecture

- **Pattern**: RESTful APIs with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Database**: Extends existing RBAC schema - no new migrations needed
- **Frontend**: Angular Signals with existing RBAC state managers

### Technology Choices

- **Backend**: Fastify + TypeBox schemas, extends Users module structure
- **Frontend**: Angular Material + TailwindCSS, WebSocket integration
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests + Playwright E2E tests

## 🔄 Implementation Plan
