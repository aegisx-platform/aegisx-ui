Scenarios: (1) Admin assigns user to department without setting permissions, user receives appropriate access via role, (2) User with supervisor role navigates to budget requests, sees approve button (RBAC check), approves request successfully, (3) User without approve permission doesn't see approve button. Test complete user journeys. Use page object pattern. | Restrictions: Must test real user interactions, use proper waits and selectors, test positive and negative cases, run against test environment | Success: E2E test suite created, covers critical user journeys, tests pass reliably, validates RBAC-based authorization works in UI, no permission flags used_

Update docs for /users/me/departments endpoints: (1) Remove permission fields from example responses, (2) Add note "Permissions managed via RBAC - see /rbac endpoints", (3) Update request examples to exclude permission parameters, (4) Add migration guide for API consumers (if external APIs exist). Update OpenAPI/Swagger export if used. Ensure clarity and completeness. | Restrictions: Must maintain professional documentation standards, ensure accuracy, provide clear examples | Success: Documentation updated accurately, clear guidance for API consumers, migration path documented if needed, examples reflect new schema_

- [ ] 32. Create migration runbook for production
  - File: `.spec-workflow/specs/rbac-permission-consolidation/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`
  - Document step-by-step production migration procedure
  - Include pre-migration checklist, execution steps, verification steps, rollback procedure
  - List required commands with exact syntax
  - Purpose: Provide clear guide for production deployment
  - _Leverage: Migration execution plan from design, tests from Phase 8_
  - _Requirements: 8, 10_
  - _Prompt: Role: DevOps Engineer with expertise in production deployments | Task: Create production migration runbook following design migration plan and requirements 8, 10. Structure: (1) Prerequisites (backups, maintenance window), (2) Pre-migration checklist (run audit, verify RBAC), (3) Execution steps (exact commands with npx, database connection strings), (4) Verification steps (query checks, API tests, log monitoring), (5) Rollback procedure (step-by-step with commands), (6) Troubleshooting guide (common issues and fixes). Include timing estimates. | Restrictions: Must be clear and unambiguous, provide exact commands, account for error scenarios, include rollback at every step | Success: Runbook created with clear steps, can be followed by any engineer, includes all necessary commands, covers success and failure paths, timing estimates provided_

- [ ] 33. Update project architecture documentation
  - Files: Architecture documentation files
  - Update diagrams to show RBAC-only permission system
  - Document removal of department permission flags
  - Explain design decisions
  - Purpose: Keep architecture documentation current
  - _Leverage: Architecture diagrams from design document_
  - _Requirements: All requirements_
  - _Prompt: Role: Solutions Architect | Task: Update architecture documentation reflecting RBAC consolidation. Update: (1) System architecture diagrams (remove department permission flows), (2) Data model documentation (updated user_departments schema), (3) Permission system documentation (emphasize RBAC as single source of truth), (4) Add ADR (Architecture Decision Record) explaining why permissions consolidated. Include before/after diagrams from design. | Restrictions: Must maintain documentation consistency, ensure diagrams accurate, explain rationale clearly | Success: Architecture docs updated, RBAC system clearly documented as single permission source, design decisions explained, diagrams accurate_

- [ ] 34. Create deployment checklist
  - File: `.spec-workflow/specs/rbac-permission-consolidation/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
  - List all pre-deployment verifications
  - List all deployment steps
  - List all post-deployment verifications
  - Purpose: Ensure nothing is missed during production deployment
  - _Leverage: All previous tasks, migration runbook_

Verify: (1) All 10 requirements met, (2) All tests passing, (3) Performance acceptable, (4) No regressions, (5) Documentation complete, (6) Rollback tested and works. Create validation report with evidence (test results, screenshots, metrics). Get stakeholder sign-off if required. Document any outstanding items or known issues. | Restrictions: Must validate every requirement thoroughly, must not skip verifications, must have evidence for each item | Success: Complete validation executed, all requirements verified as met, validation report created with evidence, ready for production deployment, sign-off obtained if required_

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 35 tasks across 9 phases

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

- Phase 1-2: Preparation and mapping (3-4 days)
- Phase 3-5: Database and backend changes (5-6 days)
- Phase 6-7: Schema and frontend changes (4-5 days)
- Phase 8-9: Testing and documentation (3-4 days)

**Critical Path**:

1. Must complete audit and mapping BEFORE migration
2. Must apply migration BEFORE updating code (to test against new schema)
3. Must update backend BEFORE frontend (API contract changes)
4. Must pass all tests BEFORE production deployment

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Rollback capability at every step
- Pre-migration validation to prevent access loss
- Staging environment validation before production
