**Implementation Notes:**

1. **Sequential Execution**: Complete tasks in order. Each task builds on previous ones.
2. **Testing**: Write tests immediately after implementing features (not at the end).
3. **Commits**: Commit after each completed task with descriptive messages.
4. **Documentation**: Update task status in this file as you progress ([ ] → [-] → [x]).
5. **Logging**: Use log-implementation tool after each task to record detailed implementation artifacts.
6. **State Management**: Always mark task in_progress before starting, log after completing, then mark complete.

**Total Estimated Tasks**: 43 tasks across 7 phases
**Estimated Duration**: 3 weeks (15 working days)
**Dependencies**: Requires inventory backend modules to be functional for FIFO/FEFO integration
