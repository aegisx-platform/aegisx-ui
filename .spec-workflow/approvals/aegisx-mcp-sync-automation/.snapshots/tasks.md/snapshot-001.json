Ensure code quality standards met. | Restrictions: Must ensure all tests pass, no breaking changes to existing functionality, code is production-ready | Success: All tests pass, sync executes cleanly, aegisx-mcp builds successfully, MCP server works with generated data, code is clean and documented | Instructions: Log validation checklist results, any issues found and fixed, final test coverage. Mark complete in tasks.md._\n\n## Summary\n\n**Total Tasks:** 27 tasks organized in 6 phases\n\n**Estimated Effort:**\n- Phase 1 (Setup & Utilities): ~8 hours\n- Phase 2 (Extractors): ~12 hours\n- Phase 3 (Generators): ~6 hours\n- Phase 4 (Integration & CLI): ~4 hours\n- Phase 5 (Testing): ~10 hours\n- Phase 6 (Documentation & Validation): ~5 hours\n- **Total: ~45 hours**\n\n**Key Dependencies:**\n- Phases 1 must complete before Phase 2 and 3\n- Phase 4 requires completion of Phases 1, 2, and 3\n- Phase 5 can run alongside Phase 4 (some tests can be written during development)\n- Phase 6 is final and requires all other phases complete\n\n**Critical Path:**\nSetup → Utilities → Extractors → Generators → Integration → Testing → Documentation → Validation\n",
