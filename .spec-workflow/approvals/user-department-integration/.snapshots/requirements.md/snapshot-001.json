Currently, users can be assigned to departments through the user profile, but this information is not available in the authentication context or used for automatic form population in business processes like budget requests.\n\nThe integration will ensure that when users log in, their department assignment is available throughout the application, enabling:\n- Auto-population of department fields in forms (e.g., budget requests)\n- Department-based access control and filtering\n- Department approval workflows\n- Audit trails with department context\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the platform's goal of providing enterprise-grade workflow management by:\n- Enabling organizational structure-based access control\n- Streamlining business processes with automatic department context\n- Ensuring data integrity through proper department assignment validation\n- Supporting multi-department organizations with clear hierarchical workflows\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: User Authentication with Department Context\n\n**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my department assignment to be available in my authentication session, so that I don't have to manually select my department in every form.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL include department_id in the authentication response\n2. WHEN a user's profile is loaded THEN the system SHALL fetch and cache their department_id\n3. IF a user has multiple department assignments THEN the system SHALL use their primary department\n4. WHEN the authentication token is refreshed THEN the system SHALL maintain department_id in the user context\n5. IF a user's department assignment changes THEN the system SHALL reflect this change in their next login session\n\n### REQ-2: Backend User Profile Enhancement\n\n**User Story:** As a backend system, I want to store and retrieve user department assignments, so that department context is available for authorization and business logic.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN retrieving user profile THEN the system SHALL include department_id field\n2. WHEN creating a new user THEN the system SHALL allow optional department_id assignment\n3. WHEN updating a user THEN the system SHALL allow department_id modification\n4. IF department_id is provided THEN the system SHALL validate that the department exists and is active\n5. WHEN querying users THEN the system SHALL support filtering by department_id\n6. WHEN deleting a department THEN the system SHALL handle users assigned to that department appropriately (set to null or prevent deletion)\n\n### REQ-3: Frontend User Interface Integration\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my department information in my profile and have department fields auto-populated in forms, so that I can work more efficiently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing my profile THEN the system SHALL display my assigned department with full hierarchy path\n2. WHEN editing my profile THEN the system SHALL allow viewing but not editing my department (admin-only)\n3. WHEN creating a budget request THEN the system SHALL auto-populate department_id from my profile\n4. IF I am an admin creating a budget request for another department THEN the system SHALL allow me to override the department selection\n5. WHEN viewing a list of users THEN the system SHALL display each user's department name\n\n### REQ-4: Budget Request Auto-Population\n\n**User Story:** As a user creating a budget request, I want my department to be automatically selected, so that I don't have to find and select it manually every time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN opening the budget request form THEN the system SHALL pre-fill department_id with my assigned department\n2. IF I have no department assignment THEN the system SHALL show a warning and require manual department selection\n3. WHEN submitting a budget request THEN the system SHALL validate that department_id is provided\n4. IF department_id is not provided THEN the system SHALL prevent submission with a clear error message\n5. WHEN approving a budget request THEN the system SHALL ensure department_id exists before creating allocations\n\n### REQ-5: User-Department Validation\n\n**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity between users and departments, so that there are no orphaned references or invalid assignments.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN assigning a user to a department THEN the system SHALL verify the department exists\n2. IF the department is inactive THEN the system SHALL warn but allow the assignment\n3. WHEN a department is deleted THEN the system SHALL either set affected users' department_id to null OR prevent deletion if users are assigned\n4. WHEN querying budget requests THEN the system SHALL handle missing department_id gracefully\n5. IF a user has an invalid department_id THEN the system SHALL log the error and allow login but flag the issue\n\n### REQ-6: Migration and Backward Compatibility\n\n**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want existing users and data to work seamlessly after the department integration, so that there is no service disruption.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN existing users SHALL have department_id set to null by default\n2. WHEN a user with null department_id logs in THEN the system SHALL allow login without errors\n3. IF a user with null department_id creates a budget request THEN the system SHALL require manual department selection\n4. WHEN viewing existing budget requests THEN the system SHALL handle null department_id gracefully (show \"All Departments\")\n5. WHEN the migration completes THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work without modification\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component (auth service, user service, budget service) should handle department integration in its own scope\n- **Modular Design**: Department integration should be implemented as reusable utilities that can be applied to other modules\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between auth layer and business logic layers\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define typed interfaces for User objects with department_id across all layers\n\n### Performance\n\n- Loading user profile with department SHALL complete within 200ms\n- Department validation queries SHALL be cached to minimize database hits\n- Authentication token refresh SHALL not add more than 50ms overhead\n- List queries with department filtering SHALL use proper database indexes\n\n### Security\n\n- Department_id in authentication context SHALL be tamper-proof (server-side validation)\n- Users SHALL NOT be able to forge or modify their own department assignment\n- Admin-only operations (department assignment) SHALL be protected by proper permissions\n- Department-based access control SHALL be enforced at the API layer, not just UI\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Missing department assignments SHALL NOT cause application crashes\n- Department validation failures SHALL return clear, actionable error messages\n- System SHALL gracefully handle edge cases (inactive departments, deleted departments)\n- All database operations SHALL use transactions to ensure data consistency\n\n### Usability\n\n- Department selection in forms SHALL use searchable dropdowns for large organizations\n- Department hierarchy SHALL be displayed as breadcrumb paths (e.g., \"Engineering > Backend Team\")\n- Error messages SHALL clearly guide users on how to resolve department-related issues\n- Forms SHALL clearly indicate whether department is auto-filled or manually selected\n",
