Create API contract parser types and interfaces\n  - File: `libs/aegisx-mcp/src/data/api-contracts-parser.ts`\n  - Define TypeScript interfaces for ApiEndpoint, ApiContract, ErrorResponse, and ValidationReport\n  - Purpose: Establish type-safe data structures for API contract parsing\n  - _Leverage: libs/aegisx-mcp/src/data/components.ts (for interface patterns)_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_\n  - _Prompt: **Implement the task for spec api-contract-tools, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task:**\n\n    **Role:** TypeScript Developer specializing in data modeling and parser design\n\n    **Task:** Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API contract data structures in `libs/aegisx-mcp/src/data/api-contracts-parser.ts` following requirements 1.1 and 1.5 (Requirements, Requirement 1 and Requirement 5). Reference the existing component data structure patterns from `libs/aegisx-mcp/src/data/components.ts` to maintain consistency.\n\n    **Context:** This is part of the aegisx-mcp server that provides MCP tools for discovering and validating API contracts. The interfaces need to represent:\n    - Individual API endpoints with method, path, schemas, examples\n    - Complete API contracts (collection of endpoints per feature)\n    - Error responses with status codes\n    - Validation reports comparing docs vs implementation\n\n    **Restrictions:**\n    - Do not implement parsing logic yet (only types/interfaces in this task)\n    - Follow existing naming conventions from components.ts\n    - Use strict TypeScript types (no 'any')\n    - Ensure interfaces support optional fields appropriately\n\n    **_Leverage:** libs/aegisx-mcp/src/data/components.ts for interface patterns\n\n    **_Requirements:** 1.1 (List All API Endpoints), 1.5 (Parse API Contract Documents)\n\n    **Success Criteria:**\n    - All interfaces compile without TypeScript errors\n    - Interfaces cover all fields mentioned in requirements\n    - Proper use of optional fields and union types\n    - Export statements for all public interfaces\n\n    **Instructions:**\n    - Before starting: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 1 status from `[ ]` to `[-]`\n    - After completion: Use `log-implementation` tool to record implementation with detailed artifacts (interfaces created, file paths, code statistics)\n    - After logging: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 1 status from `[-]` to `[x]`\n\n- [ ] 2.

Create functions to:\n    1. Recursively find all `api-contracts.md` files under `docs/features/`\n    2. Read file contents asynchronously\n    3. Implement in-memory caching with cache invalidation\n\n    **Context:** These functions will be used by the parser to load contract files efficiently. Multiple MCP tool calls may request the same data, so caching is important for performance.\n\n    **Restrictions:**\n    - Use Node.js `fs.promises` for all file operations\n    - Do not use synchronous fs methods\n    - Cache must be refreshable (don't cache forever)\n    - Handle file read errors gracefully (don't crash on missing files)\n    - Do not parse markdown yet (only read raw content)\n\n    **_Leverage:** Node.js fs.promises, path module\n\n    **_Requirements:** 1.5 (Parse API Contract Documents)\n\n    **Success Criteria:**\n    - Functions successfully find all contract files in docs/features/\n    - File reading is asynchronous and handles errors\n    - Caching reduces file I/O for repeated requests\n    - Cache can be cleared or invalidated\n\n    **Instructions:**\n    - Before starting: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 2 status from `[ ]` to `[-]`\n    - After completion: Use `log-implementation` tool with detailed artifacts (functions created, caching strategy, file paths)\n    - After logging: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 2 status from `[-]` to `[x]`\n\n- [ ] 3.

Find specific endpoint by path and optional method\n    4. Rank search results by relevance\n\n    **Context:** These utilities will be called by MCP tool handlers to implement list, search, and get operations. Search should be case-insensitive and support partial matching.\n\n    **Restrictions:**\n    - Use native JavaScript array methods (no external search libraries)\n    - Search must be case-insensitive\n    - Support partial matching (e.g., \"budget\" matches \"/api/budget-allocations\")\n    - Prioritize exact method matches in search results\n    - Return empty arrays (not null) when no matches found\n\n    **_Leverage:** Array.filter, Array.find, Array.map, String.toLowerCase, String.includes\n\n    **_Requirements:** 1.1 (List All API Endpoints), 1.2 (Search API Endpoints), 1.3 (Get API Contract Details)\n\n    **Success Criteria:**\n    - Search returns relevant endpoints with keyword matching\n    - Filter correctly isolates endpoints by feature\n    - Find accurately locates endpoints by path/method\n    - Relevance ranking prioritizes better matches\n\n    **Instructions:**\n    - Before starting: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 4 status from `[ ]` to `[-]`\n    - After completion: Use `log-implementation` tool with detailed artifacts (utility functions created, search algorithm details)\n    - After logging: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 4 status from `[-]` to `[x]`\n\n- [ ] 5.

Test tools manually using MCP client (Claude Desktop or test harness)\n    5. Verify output formatting is correct and helpful\n    6. Check that caching works and improves performance\n\n    **Context:** This is the final verification step. The MCP server should be production-ready and all tools should work as designed.\n\n    **Restrictions:**\n    - Must pass `pnpm run build` with zero errors\n    - Do not skip TypeScript errors (fix them properly)\n    - Test with real MCP client if possible\n    - Verify tool descriptions are clear for users\n    - Ensure error messages are helpful\n\n    **_Leverage:** pnpm build system, MCP client for manual testing\n\n    **_Requirements:** All (1.1-1.5)\n\n    **Success Criteria:**\n    - Build completes successfully with no errors\n    - All 4 tools are accessible and functional\n    - Manual testing confirms correct behavior\n    - Output is well-formatted and useful\n    - Performance is acceptable (sub-second responses)\n\n    **Instructions:**\n    - Before starting: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 12 status from `[ ]` to `[-]`\n    - After completion: Use `log-implementation` tool with detailed artifacts (build output, manual test results, any fixes applied)\n    - After logging: Edit `.spec-workflow/specs/api-contract-tools/tasks.md` and change task 12 status from `[-]` to `[x]`\n",
