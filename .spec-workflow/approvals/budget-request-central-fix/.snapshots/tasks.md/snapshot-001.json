  "content": "# Budget Request Central Fix - Tasks\n\n**Version:** 1.0.0\n**Created:** 2025-12-17\n**Status:** Ready for Implementation\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Code Changes (Priority: HIGH)\n\n- [ ] 1.1 Update create() method to accept null department_id\n  - File: apps/api/src/layers/domains/inventory/budget/budgetRequests/budget-requests.service.ts\n  - Lines: 87-148\n  - Remove auto-populate logic that throws USER_NO_DEPARTMENT error\n  - Accept department_id from request data directly, allow null values\n  - Add audit logging when department_id is null\n  - Simplify method from ~60 lines to ~30 lines\n  - _Leverage: Existing this.logger, this.generateRequestNumber(), super.create() methods_\n  - _Requirements: BR-1, TR-1_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Backend Service Developer | Task: Update the BudgetRequestsService.create() method to support central budget requests with null department_id by removing auto-populate logic (lines 100-132) and accepting department_id from request directly, maintaining backward compatibility with department-specific requests | Restrictions: Do not modify method signature, do not remove request_number generation logic, do not change other methods in the service, must add audit logging for central requests | Success: Auto-populate logic completely removed, method accepts null department_id without throwing error, audit log written when department_id is null, method simplified to approximately 30 lines, TypeScript compilation passes, no breaking changes to existing functionality_\n\n- [ ] 1.2 Update approveFinance() method to skip allocations for central requests\n  - File: apps/api/src/layers/domains/inventory/budget/budgetRequests/budget-requests.service.ts\n  - Lines: 618-628\n  - Replace error throw with skip logic when department_id is null\n  - Use continue statement to skip budget_allocations creation\n  - Add audit logging for skipped allocations\n  - Allow finance approval to complete successfully\n  - _Leverage: Existing this.logger, continue statement for loop control_\n  - _Requirements: BR-2, TR-2_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Backend Service Developer | Task: Update the BudgetRequestsService.approveFinance() method to skip allocation creation for central budget requests by replacing error throw with skip logic and continue statement, while maintaining allocation creation for department-specific requests | Restrictions: Do not modify method signature, do not remove status update logic, do not change allocation creation logic for department-specific requests, must add audit logging for skipped allocations | Success: Error throw for null department_id removed, skip logic added with continue statement, audit log written when allocations skipped, finance approval succeeds for central requests, TypeScript compilation passes, department-specific requests still create allocations_\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Testing (Priority: HIGH)\n\n- [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for central budget request support\n  - File: apps/api/src/layers/domains/inventory/budget/budgetRequests/budget-requests.service.spec.ts\n  - Test create() with null department_id (should succeed)\n  - Test create() does not throw USER_NO_DEPARTMENT error\n  - Test approveFinance() with null department_id (should succeed)\n  - Test approveFinance() skips allocation creation for null department_id\n  - Test backward compatibility with department-specific requests\n  - _Leverage: Existing test utilities, mocking patterns in spec file, Jest matchers_\n  - _Requirements: BR-1, BR-2, BR-3_\n  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer / Test Developer | Task: Write comprehensive unit tests for central budget request support covering create() method with null department_id and approveFinance() with null department_id, verifying no errors thrown, allocations skipped, and backward compatibility maintained | Restrictions: Do not modify service implementation, do not skip test cases, must mock database calls appropriately, must test both success and edge cases | Success: All 5 test cases implemented (create with null, no USER_NO_DEPARTMENT error, approve finance without allocations, skip allocation creation, department-specific still works), tests pass with npm test or pnpm test, code coverage maintained or improved, mock setup is clean and reusable_\n\n- [ ] 2.2 Perform integration testing of full workflow\n  - Test: POST /api/inventory/budget/budget-requests with null department_id\n  - Test: Full workflow Create → Submit → Dept Approve → Finance Approve\n  - Start API server and use curl or Postman for testing\n  - Verify all endpoints return correct status codes (201 Created, 200 OK)\n  - Verify no errors in server logs\n  - Verify audit messages appear in logs\n  - _Leverage: curl or Postman, server logs from pnpm run dev:api, existing test user tokens_\n  - _Requirements: BR-1, BR-2, BR-3_\n  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer | Task: Perform end-to-end integration testing of central budget request workflow by testing API endpoints with real server, verifying create request with null department_id succeeds and full approval workflow completes successfully without allocation errors | Restrictions: Do not modify any code, must use real API server not mocks, must verify logs for audit messages, must test with actual authentication tokens | Success: Create request with null department_id succeeds (201 Created), full approval workflow completes successfully, finance approval succeeds without allocation errors, server logs show audit messages, no error responses or stack traces_\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Documentation (Priority: MEDIUM)\n\n- [ ] 3.1 Update API documentation in Swagger\n  - Update: Swagger/OpenAPI schema for budget requests endpoints\n  - Document department_id field as optional and nullable\n  - Add example request showing central request with null department_id\n  - Update error codes documentation (USER_NO_DEPARTMENT removed from create endpoint)\n  - Verify in Swagger UI: http://localhost:4249/documentation\n  - _Leverage: Existing Swagger decorators in route files, TypeBox schema definitions_\n  - _Requirements: BR-1, BR-2_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Technical Writer / API Documentation Specialist | Task: Update API documentation in Swagger to reflect central budget request support by documenting nullable department_id field and adding example showing central request creation | Restrictions: Do not modify route handlers, must follow existing documentation format, must include both central and department-specific examples | Success: Swagger UI displays updated schema, department_id documented as optional and nullable, example request with null department_id added, error code documentation updated to remove USER_NO_DEPARTMENT from create endpoint_\n\n- [ ] 3.2 Add JSDoc comments to modified methods\n  - File: apps/api/src/layers/domains/inventory/budget/budgetRequests/budget-requests.service.ts\n  - Add JSDoc comments to create() method explaining null department_id behavior\n  - Add JSDoc comments to approveFinance() method explaining allocation skipping\n  - Include @param, @returns, @throws tags\n  - Document central request concept and use cases\n  - Verify TypeScript intellisense shows documentation in IDE\n  - _Leverage: Existing JSDoc patterns in service file, TypeScript types for accurate documentation_\n  - _Requirements: BR-1, BR-2_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Code Documentation Specialist | Task: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to create() and approveFinance() methods documenting null department_id behavior, central request concept, and allocation skipping logic | Restrictions: Do not modify method implementations, must follow JSDoc syntax, must include @param and @returns tags | Success: JSDoc comments added to both methods, null department_id behavior documented, examples included in comments, TypeScript intellisense shows documentation in IDE_\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Deployment (Priority: MEDIUM)\n\n- [ ] 4.1 Create pull request and conduct code review\n  -
